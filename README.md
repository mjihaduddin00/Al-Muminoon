Al-Mu'minoon means in Arabic "The Believers" which resonates with the mission of this mobile application.

The teacher from whom he learned the most by studying under him was Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Naasir al-Barraak. He learned the correct recitation of Qur’an from Shaykh Sa‘eed Aal ‘Abdillah. Other shaykhs from whom he learned include: Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan Aal Fawzaan, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Ghunaymaan, Shaykh Muhammad ould Sidi al-Habeeb ash-Shinqeeti, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Muhsin az-Zaamil, and Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Saalih al-Mahmood. The one from whom he learned the most in question-and-answer sessions is Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him), with whom he had a close relationship that lasted for fifteen years. He is the one who encouraged him to teach and wrote to the Centre for Da‘wah and Irshad in Dammam, advising them to cooperate with him in offering lectures, khutbahs and classes. Thanks to Allah, then al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, he became a khateeb, imam and lecturer.)

# Issue At Hand
Almost anyone can claim being a Muslim, but not everyone can be considered a Mu'min. To achieve being at a Mu'min's level one must truly devote themeselves to the religion إن شاء الله. This is not an easy task, but we are in hopes that إن شاء الله the app will at least be of assistance in guiding individuals into the correct direction. 

Currently, Muslims are in a place of great tribulation. We are in times where people are speaking without knowledge, without sources, and simply out of their own logic that bring no good to the Ummah, but rather destroy it. We hope that Insh'Allah we can aid in guiding Muslims to the truth, to understanding their religion in detail, and to be blessed to be a Muslim!
